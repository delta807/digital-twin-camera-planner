## CWD drift between Bash calls (2026-06-04)
The shell re-initializes from the user's profile between some Bash calls, so the
working directory can silently reset from the project dir to the PARENT
`/Users/laptop/Projects/lerobot` — which is a DIFFERENT git repo
(so101-jetson-rig-dashboard). A bare `git push` there failed/targeted the wrong
repo; a bare `tsc` failed with "no such file". No work was lost (commits were
made while CWD happened to be correct), but this could have been catastrophic.
RULE: prefix EVERY Bash command that touches the project (git, tsc, npm, file
ops) with `cd /Users/laptop/Projects/lerobot/digital-twin-camera-planner && ...`.
Never run a bare git/tsc command assuming CWD persists.
